## Model selection (3 different models)

By plotting the outcome variable against different variables, we could identify a linear relationship, especially between parasitemia percentage and the outcome variable (see figure X) which suggested to use a linear model. 
After checking the model assumptions for that, see subchapter _Checking assumptions of linear regression model_ [INSERT LINK HERE], we also built generalized linear models as well as performed beta regression.

We tried multiple combinations of different equally suitable and non-collinear variables, the best yet simple general lineararized models are implemented in chapter _Results_ [INSERT LINK HERE].
