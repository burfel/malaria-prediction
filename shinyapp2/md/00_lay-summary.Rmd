# Lay-summary: Can we predict parasite read depth in whole blood dual-RNA Seq data from malaria patients?

The following website provides a tool for physicians and biologists working in malaria research to assisst them to produce the right amount of reads for a specific coverage required for the analysis. The tool predicts the average percentage of Dual RNA-Seq [EXPLAIN TERM] reads that map to the host and to the pathogen based on some information of the patient, including parasitemia percentage and white blood cell count.
