# Conclusion

Based on the given data sets of dual RNA-seq reads and different measurements of the malaria patients, we developed a simple general linear model that appropriately predicts the percentage of reads that will map to the host and to the pathogen. [GIVE SOME STATISTICS HERE]

The model was kept simple in order for the malaria community to be easy to use and the results easy to interpret. Also, we restricted the variables to the measurements a user is most likely to have. 

We hope that this webtool will turn out to be useful for the malaria community.
