## Conclusion

- COMPARE TO MOUSE DATA SET? BUT NOT MUCH INSIGHT...

We wanted to avoid models that generate highly complex, non-linear relationships between the predictors and the outcome. 

Unfortunately, the predictive models that are most powerful are usually the least interpretable. 
However, as interpretability is not the primary goal in predictive models, it may not be appropriate to use a model that is built for interpretation rather than predictive performance as long as complex models are properly validated.
