## Discussion: Practical relevance
<big>
The web tool in chapter _Results_ is ready to use and will be maintained and further developed and validated by the author. 
The motivation for the development of this tool was outlined in chapter _Introduction_. Dual RNA-seq used to understand 
host-pathogen interactions is an expensive and labour-intensive process, that is dependent on mainly two factors (sequence depth 
and number of samples). For the former, malaria researchers want to know the number of reads required in order to achieve a certain 
minimum sequencing depths for both host and parasite in order to quantify their gene expression. 
Here our web tool can contribute to predict the average percentage of dual RNA-seq reads that will map to the host and to the pathogen 
given some basic information on the sample.
