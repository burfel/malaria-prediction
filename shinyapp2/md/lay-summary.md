# Lay-summary: Can we predict parasite read depth in whole blood dual-RNA Seq data from malaria patients?


The following website provides a tool for physicians and biologists working in malaria research to predict the percentage of Dual RNA-Seq [EXPLAIN TERM] reads that map to the host and to the pathogen based on some information of the patient. This will help the researchers to produce the right amount of reads for a specific coverage required for the analysis.
