## The generalized linear model (GLM)

In cases where for certain response variables the just tested assumptions do not hold, generalized linear models (GLM) are excellent at dealing with them. 
GLMs are especially recommended either when
* the variance is not constant (heteroscedasticity) and/or
* the errors are not normally distributed.

Especially in our case where the response variable is a percentage or a proportion derived from count data, GLMs prove especially useful. We use a logistic regression, which is similar to a linear regression except for the logit link function. The logit link function is simply a function that is applied to the mean of the outcome variable instead of the outcome itself. 
It has a couple of advantages
* The results are relatively easy to interpret.
* Once the model is fit, we can easily back-transform the estimated regression coefficients off of a log scale so that we can interpret the effects of each independent variable.

Additionally, we used statistical methods as proposed in INSERT REFERENCE HERE to empirically identify an appropriate transformation. Box and Cox (1964) proposed a __family__ of transformations that are indexed by a parameter, denoted as LAMBDA [INSERT REFERENCE HERE].
