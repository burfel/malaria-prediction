## Variable Selection

The goal was to keep the model as small as possible but as best performing as possible. Certainly there is a trade-off (see chapter _Discussion_ [INSERT LINK HERE]).
The categorical variables (includin sex and ethnicity) were encoded as dummy variables.

Moreover, we looked at the correlation matrix to choose "good" variables to include in our model, ie the ones that do not correlate much with the first independent variable so that a small model can caputure much variance and results in a better performance.

Here, domain knowledge was important too. Also, we chose the variable(s) based on the utility for the user. Most often people will just have parasitemia or parasite density data. In some cases they may have white cell count data, too.
