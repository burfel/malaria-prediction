#------Specifying the user interface object and implementing the server function
#------1. ADDING INPUTS TO THE SIDEBAR

#------2. CREATING THE SERVER FUNCTION
# now: define server-side of the application which will accept inputs and compute outputs. 
# Server function shown below, illustrates some important concepts:
# - Accessing input using slots on the input object and generating output by assigning to slots on the output object.
# - Initializing data at startup that can be accessed throughout the lifetime of the application.
# - Using a reactive expression to compute a value shared by more than one output.
# Basic task of a Shiny server function is to define the relationship between inputs and outputs. 
# Our function does this by accessing inputs to perform computations and by assigning reactive expressions to output slots.

# NOTE: The use of renderText and renderPlot to generate output (rather than just assigning values directly) 
# is what makes the application reactive. These reactive wrappers return special expressions that are only re-executed when 
# their dependencies change. This behavior is what enables Shiny to automatically update output whenever input changes.

#------3. DISPLAYING OUTPUTS
